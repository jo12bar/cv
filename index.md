## About Me

I am a second-year mechanical engineering co-op student at the University of Alberta. My focus in this field is on mechatronics, and the interaction between electrical, computer, and mechanical engineering in general. I have always been interested in how things work, and grew up taking things apart and attempting to put them back together again! I have held a variety of volunteer jobs, teaching me the value of compassion, hard work and perseverance. I am a passionate student of music, karate, physics, mathematics, photography, and life. I strive, every day, to make the world around me just a little bit brighter, better, and happier.

I hope you enjoy exploring my website and learning more about me!
