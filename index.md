## About Me

I am a fifth-year mechanical engineering co-op student at the University of Alberta.
My focus in this field is on mechatronics, and the interaction between electrical,
computer, and mechanical engineering in general. I have always been interested in how
things work, and grew up taking things apart and attempting to put them back together
again. I love working with my hands in the shop, designing mechanical systems, and
solving complex software problems with sophisticated code. Programming has been
a hobby of mine for over a decade, and I hope to supplement it with my mechanical
engineering knowledge to solve the problems of the future.

I have held a variety of volunteer jobs, teaching me the value of compassion,
hard work and perseverance. I am a passionate student of music, karate, physics,
mathematics, photography, and life. Every day I strive to make the world around me
just a little brighter, better, and happier.

Please, enjoy exploring my website and learning more about me! If you wish to
